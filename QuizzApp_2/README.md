# Quiz App Project

Welcome to the Quiz App Project! This application is designed to provide an engaging quiz experience using a custom implementation of a linked list data structure. The application offers various interactive features, including question management, a helpline system, and colorful console-based displays.

## Features

### Linked List Implementation

The core of this quiz app is built on a custom `LinkedList` data structure. This implementation supports operations such as adding questions to the end or beginning of the list, removing specific questions or questions at a particular index, retrieving questions based on their position in the list, and displaying the list of questions.

### Quiz Functionality

The app provides a comprehensive quiz experience with the following features:

- **Helplines**: During the quiz, users can access helplines to assist them in answering questions. The available helplines include:
  - **Reduce Options**: This helpline eliminates two incorrect options from the list.
  - **Give Correct Answer**: This helpline reveals the correct answer.
  - **Give a Hint**: Provides a helpful hint related to the question.
  - **Call a Friend**: Simulates a phone call to a friend for help.

### Colorful Console Displays

To enhance the user experience, the application includes various colorful and dynamic console display options:

- **Typewriter Effect with Blinking**: Messages are displayed with a typewriter effect followed by a blinking animation.
- **Colorful Loading Animation**: Shows a message with a colorful loading animation to indicate processing or waiting.
- **Typewriter Display**: Displays messages as if they are being typed out.
- **Blinking Effect**: Messages blink to attract attention.
